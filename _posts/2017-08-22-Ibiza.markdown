This is going back five years, but is an experience I’ll never forget. It doesn’t matter the kind of person you are, I think it’s important to step out of your comfort zone and try something new. After living and working in London for almost four years, I decided to break the exhausting routine that was my life at the time. Moving out to Ibiza for the Summer was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made and taught me a lot about what I want out of life. I worked for both a private yacht trip company and a scuba diving school which meant that every single day, I was working on the harbour, five metres from the sea. I worked seven days a week and sometimes it was really hard, but simply being on ‘The White Isle’ as it’s known, made it all worth it; the sun, the music, the atmosphere and most of all, my friends. Being able to go to the beach or boat parties any time of the week, every day is different and the opportunities are always there to meet interesting people. With all that said, you need to have a thick skin to survive the season especially considering that sleep is a real luxury out there. Obviously this massively depends on where you are on the island, however if you're based in Sant Antonio, be prepared for the chaos that is the West End.
