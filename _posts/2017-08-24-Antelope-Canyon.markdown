Located on a hillside just 20km away from Nice, sits one of my favourite places of all time, Saint Paul de Vence. What can only be described as a historical labyrinth, the streets of Saint Paul de Vence are lined with art galleries, restaurants, churches and of course your typical provencal boutiques. Starting with the galleries, the amount and variety is outstanding, particularly when you consider the size of the small medieval town. There are two in particular that stand out and of course, when it comes to art, everyone has their own preference. But for me, the ODD Gallery and Galerie du Vieux Saint Paul are my personal favourites. The Galerie du Vieux Saint Paul often houses a wide selection of Dali and Lothar sculptures for example whilst the ODD Gallery displays a variety of powerful photography and sculptural pieces produced by up and coming artists including Pierre Taurtaut who’s photography work is just beautiful.
But the town itself is just as inspiring; the architecture, the atmosphere, the views. From the distinctive cobbled streets, to the abundance of floral archways and bronze statues, Saint Paul de Vence is truly worth visiting. Even before entering the Village itself, it’s worth taking a little detour through the hills where you’ll not only find the perfect view of Saint Paul, but also a number of abandoned and derelict chapels bringing a further element of mystery to the place.
In regards to restaurants and cafes, I cannot recommend enough Restaurant Le Tilleul although I’ll admit, there’s often a waiting list depending on the time of year. I’ve always been impressed by the service and quality of food which explains why this restaurant in particular is so popular amongst both tourists and locals. But again, we’re honestly spoilt for choice when it comes to where and what we can eat.
Saint Paul de Vence is perhaps one of the most impressive villages along the Cote d’Azur.
